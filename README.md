# üß¨ Stromal Architecture in Healthy Mouse Colon

This project investigates stromal organization in the healthy mouse colon using **MERFISH spatial transcriptomics**. It focuses on **fibroblast** and **smooth muscle cell (SMC)** populations, exploring their spatial subclusters and local neighborhoods through **Squidpy (Python)** and **RANN (R)** methods.

## üìÑ Key Files

- **Healthy Feature Plots and Spatial Neighborhood.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook containing the full healthy colon spatial analysis ‚Äî from preprocessing and clustering to fibroblast and SMC neighborhood visualization using Squidpy.

- **Spatial Neighborhood RANN.R**  
  R script implementing the RANN algorithm for distance-based *k*-nearest-neighbor computation and neighborhood composition analysis.

## üß† Summary

Using **MERFISH**, we mapped all healthy colon cells, identified major clusters, and zoomed into fibroblast and SMC subsets.  
By combining **graph-based** (Squidpy) and **distance-based** (RANN) neighborhood analyses, we reveal consistent stromal architectures and key fibroblast‚ÄìSMC interfaces that may underlie normal tissue organization.
